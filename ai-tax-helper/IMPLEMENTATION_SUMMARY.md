     You could save approximately $1,287.50 in taxes this year."
```

#### 2. **Context Understanding**
Maintains conversation context and understands related questions:
```python
User: "What are my expenses?"
Bot: "You have $6050 in total expenses from 7 transactions..."

User: "Which ones are deductible?"
Bot: "Of these, $5150 are business expenses that may be tax-deductible..."
```

#### 3. **Intelligent Fallback**
Works perfectly without external AI APIs by using smart mock responses based on user data.
